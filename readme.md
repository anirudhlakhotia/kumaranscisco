Hello, 

!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!

This project requires you to have node.js and angular installed. Please try and install these on your own.

!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!

This project is still under development 

!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!


For those who want to test out the production builds of our service, you can do so. Here is what you need to do.

1. Navigate to production build and download our latest build 
  ** The Angular app contains the angular files, as the name suggest, and the node folder contains the backend code ** 
2. To run, clone the project, and then open two terminals for the Angualar and Node Folders
3. Run ng-serve and then proceed to run node app  on the other terminal
4. That's basically it, whatever data you enter in your angular localhost app must be reflected in your database.


If there are any missing dependencies, please run npm install in both folder to install the dependencies
